# End-to-End Car Price Prediction Project  

This repository contains the code and steps for an **End-to-End Car Price Prediction Project**. The goal of this project is to predict the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The model is built using **Machine Learning** techniques, with thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Preprocessing** steps, and the final model is deployed using **Flask**.

## üõ† **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for predicting car prices:
1. **Data Collection**: Using the **Car Data** dataset, which contains features such as car make, model, year, mileage, and more.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset, identifying missing values, visualizing distributions, and detecting correlations.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical values.
4. **Modeling**: Training machine learning models, with **RandomForestRegressor** being the primary algorithm, and selecting the best model for prediction.
5. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model as a web service using **Flask** to serve predictions in real-time.

## üîë **Key Features**  
- **Model Training**: Built using popular machine learning algorithms, with **RandomForestRegressor** as the primary model for car price prediction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to understand relationships between features and the car price.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for handling missing data, categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Flask Deployment**: A simple web interface to input car details and get price predictions in real-time.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Input fields for users to submit car details and get predictions.

---

## üìÇ **Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project is the **Car Data** dataset, which includes various features related to car details such as:
- **Make and Model**: The car‚Äôs brand and model.
- **Year**: Year of manufacture.
- **Mileage**: Number of kilometers the car has been driven.
- **Fuel Type**: Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.
- **Transmission**: Automatic, Manual.
- **Car Price**: The target variable we want to predict.

> **Note**: The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame and preprocessed before training the model.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Model Architecture**  
- **Feature Engineering**: Categorical features like make, model, and fuel type are encoded using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.  
- **Model Selection**: The best-performing model is chosen based on cross-validation results.
  - **RandomForestRegressor**: A powerful ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy.
  - Other models such as **Linear Regression** or **XGBoost** can also be tested, but **RandomForestRegressor** is the primary model.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, or **R-Squared**.

---

## üìä **EDA and Data Preprocessing**  
### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualizations using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to explore relationships and distributions:
  - Price vs. Year, Mileage, Fuel Type, and more.
  - Detecting outliers, missing values, and skewed distributions.
  
### **Data Preprocessing**  
- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputation or removal of missing values.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Label encoding or one-hot encoding for features like car make, model, and fuel type.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing or standardizing numerical features to improve model performance.
- **Train-Test Split**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

---

## üåê **Deployment with Flask**  
The trained model is deployed using **Flask**, which allows users to interact with the model via a web interface.

### **Deployment Flow**:
1. **Flask API**:  
   - Exposes an endpoint to receive car features as input and return the predicted price.
   - Routes to render HTML pages where users can input car details.
   
2. **Web Interface**:  
   - Simple form with input fields for car details.
   - Displays the predicted car price after processing.

3. **Running the Flask Application**:  
   The app can be run locally or hosted on platforms like **Heroku** or **AWS**.

### **Run Locally**:  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/HelpRam/End-to-end-Car-price-prediction-project.git
   cd End-to-End-Car-Price-Prediction  
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```

4. Access the application in your browser at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## üí° **How to Use**  
1. **Enter Car Details**: Fill in the form with the car‚Äôs make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission type.
2. **Submit**: Press the "Predict Price" button to get the estimated car price.
3. **View Results**: The predicted price will be displayed on the website.
